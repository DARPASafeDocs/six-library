 *  \class ComplexDataBuilder
 *  \brief Incrementally builds a ComplexData object
 *
 *  This class implements the Builder design pattern by building 
 *  and maintaining a ComplexData instance.  A builder allows you to
 *  incrementally navigate the initialization of an object, and fills
 *  in many of the details for you.  Each method in this class can
 *  be cascaded, since it returns a reference to itself.
